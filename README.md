# ShortcutCycle

ShortcutCycle helps you switch between your favorite apps with just one keyboard shortcut. Instead of remembering many shortcuts, just group your apps (like "Chat Apps" or "Work Apps") and use one key to cycle through them.

## Features

- **Group Apps**: Put related apps together (e.g., "Browsers" for Chrome, Safari, Edge; or "Messaging" for Slack, Discord, Messages).
- **One Key Magic**: Press your shortcut to open the first app. Press it again to switch to the next one.
- **See What's Happening**: A nice overlay shows you which app is coming up next.
- **Your Language**: Works in 15 languages including English, Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, and many more.
- **Save Your Settings**: Easily save your settings to a file to keep them safe or share with friends.
- **Light & Dark**: Looks great in both Light and Dark modes.

## How to Install

1. Get the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/xcv58/ShortcutCycle/releases) page.
2. Drag `ShortcutCycle` to your Applications folder.
3. Open the app. You'll see a small icon in your menu bar.
4. The app will ask for **Accessibility Permissions**. This is needed so it can listen to your shortcuts.

## How to Use

1. Click the menu bar icon and pick **Settings...**.
2. Click the `+` button to make a new group of apps.
3. Drag the apps you want into the group.
4. Record a keyboard shortcut (like `Option + 1`).
5. Close the window.
6. Now, just press `Option + 1` to open or switch between your apps!
