## Screenshots Guide (Required)

Follow this step-by-step guide to create high-quality screenshots that meet Apple's requirements (Mac 12.9" Display).

### 1. Requirements
*   **Resolution**: 16:10 aspect ratio. **2880 x 1800** pixels is the golden standard.
*   **Format**: PNG (preferred) or High-Quality JPEG. No transparency (alpha channel).
*   **Count**: 1-10 screenshots per localization.

### 2. Strategy: Themes & Localization
*   **Themes**: Capture your main scenarios in **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**. Apple's App Store automatically shows the version matching the user's system setting if you provide both.
*   **Languages**: You support 15 languages! To increase global conversion, capture the UI in key markets:
    *   **English (US)**
    *   **Japanese**
    *   **Chinese (Simplified)**
    *   **German** / **Spanish**

### 3. Step-by-Step Workflow
1.  **Preparation**:
    *   Set your wallpaper to distinct solid colors or the minimal macOS default (Abstract).
    *   Hide your desktop icons (`defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false; killall Finder`).
    *   Open **ShortcutCycle**.
2.  **Capture Scenes**:
    *   **Main Window**: Show the Group List populated with realistic example groups ("Coding", "Social", "Design").
    *   **HUD Overlay (Critical)**: Use a timer (Open `Screenshot.app` > Options > Timer 5s) to capture the HUD mid-cycle. This explains your app's core value instantly.
    *   **Settings UI**: Show generic settings or the Language Picker to hint at customization.
    *   **Menu Bar**: Open the menu bar dropdown to show quick controls.
3.  **Process**:
    *   Ensure the window shadows are consistent (or remove them if putting into a device frame).
    *   Resize strictly to **2880 x 1800** or **2560 x 1600**.

### 4. Recommended Tools (Mac Compatible)
*   **Screenshots.pro** (Free/Web):
    1.  Select "Desktop" or "MacBook" device.
    2.  Upload screenshot.
    3.  Download.
*   **Canva** (Free/Paid):
    *   Search for "Mac App Store Screenshot".
    *   Drag your screenshot into the pre-made MacBook frames.
    *   This is often the most reliable way to get the exact 2880x1800 dimension.
