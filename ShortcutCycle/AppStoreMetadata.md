## Description
ShortcutCycle helps you switch between your favorite apps with just one keyboard shortcut. Instead of remembering many shortcuts, just group your apps and use one key to cycle through them.

**Group Your Apps by Context**
Put related apps together so they are always at your fingertips:
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Safari, Edge, or even Chrome Apps.
- **Messaging**: Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Apple Messages.
- **Development**: Xcode, Terminal, and Simulator.
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Cloud.

**One Key Magic**
Press your global shortcut to open the first app in your group. Press it again to switch to the next one. It's the fastest way to navigate your Mac without taking your hands off the keyboard.

**Key Features:**
- **Instant Access**: If an app isn't running, ShortcutCycle launches it for you.
- **Visual HUD**: A beautiful, native-looking overlay shows you which app is active and what's coming up next.
- **Your Language**: Fully localized in 15 languages, including English, Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, and more.
- **Import/Export**: Save your settings to a JSON file to keep them safe or share with others.

## Screenshots Guide (Required)

Follow this step-by-step guide to create high-quality screenshots that meet Apple's requirements (Mac 12.9" Display).

### 1. Requirements
*   **Resolution**: 16:10 aspect ratio. **2880 x 1800** pixels is the golden standard.
*   **Format**: PNG (preferred) or High-Quality JPEG. No transparency (alpha channel).
*   **Count**: 1-10 screenshots per localization.

### 2. Strategy: Themes & Localization
*   **Themes**: Capture your main scenarios in **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**. Apple's App Store automatically shows the version matching the user's system setting if you provide both.
*   **Languages**: You support 15 languages! To increase global conversion, capture the UI in key markets:
    *   **English (US)**
    *   **Japanese**
    *   **Chinese (Simplified)**
    *   **German** / **Spanish**

### 3. Step-by-Step Workflow
1.  **Preparation**:
    *   Set your wallpaper to distinct solid colors or the minimal macOS default (Abstract).
    *   Hide your desktop icons (`defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false; killall Finder`).
    *   Open **ShortcutCycle**.
2.  **Capture Scenes**:
    *   **Main Window**: Show the Group List populated with realistic example groups ("Coding", "Social", "Design").
    *   **HUD Overlay (Critical)**: Use a timer (Open `Screenshot.app` > Options > Timer 5s) to capture the HUD mid-cycle. This explains your app's core value instantly.
    *   **Settings UI**: Show generic settings or the Language Picker to hint at customization.
    *   **Menu Bar**: Open the menu bar dropdown to show quick controls.
3.  **Process**:
    *   Ensure the window shadows are consistent (or remove them if putting into a device frame).
    *   Resize strictly to **2880 x 1800** or **2560 x 1600**.

### 4. Recommended Tools (Mac Compatible)
*   **Screenshots.pro** (Free/Web):
    1.  Select "Desktop" or "MacBook" device.
    2.  Upload screenshot.
    3.  Download.
*   **Canva** (Free/Paid):
    *   Search for "Mac App Store Screenshot".
    *   Drag your screenshot into the pre-made MacBook frames.
    *   This is often the most reliable way to get the exact 2880x1800 dimension.
